# Condenser

Compress, convert and resize images.

Compress jpegs, pngs or webp images.  This uses pngquant, jpegoptim
and cwebp to do the actual compression.

The source filename and the output filename can be renamed and a
destination dir can be specified.

By default, if no options are used, the compressed file will be put in
a subdir called "condensed" in the same dir as the source file.  It
will be created if it doesn't exist.
